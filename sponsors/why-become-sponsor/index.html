        <p class="text text-padding w-75 text-center mx-auto" style="font-size: medium;">The Waconia RoboCats are a high
            school robotics team, located in Minnesota. The RoboCats are a member of the FIRST Program (For Inspiration
            and Recognition of Science and Technology). Our robotics program provides 9th-12th grade students with
            opportunity to design, build, program and compete in FIRST Robotics Competitions. Mentorship to motivate
            students in exploring future careers in science, technology, engineering and math is the core for our
            extracurricular activity; along with building self-confidence, knowledge and life skills.<br><br>
            Each year, almost 9,000 FIRST Robotics Competition(FRC) teams from around the world have six weeks to design
            and build a functional robot to perform at regional competitions after the "game" is revealed in January.
            Minnesota has 215 registered FRC teams.<br><br>
            The RoboCats take great pride in their team! They have drive, dedication and teamwork. They have qualified
            and participated in the Minnesota State High School Robotics Tournament in 2015 and 2017. They have also
            qualified and participated in the World Championships in 2015, 2017 and 2018. With the growth of the
            RoboCats, they need your support to continue to participate in the FIRST competitions. There are many facets
            to the budget. To be a member of FIRST a $5000 fee is required. Secondary competition fees are $4000 for
            each event. Building a multi-functional electronic robot is also very expensive. Along with these fees, the
            team needs building materials, tools, transportation and more. While the students pay a modest activities
            fee to participate in the RoboCats, this only covers a portion of the budget. The remaining comes from
            fundraising and sponsorship. This is why we need your support!
